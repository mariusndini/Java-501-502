Homework 1 - File IO
Due Date : Nov 02 2017 ( NO Late Submissions, I will be posting answers for you to check)

Instructions:
	EVERY file needs comments at the top which has the following information
	Name: Your Name
	Class: Class Name, what your class does
	Output: Every class NEEDS a driver and every method in the class needs to be tested
		IF your driver has output it NEEDS to be here!

	Driver: EVERY Class NEEDS a driver. Every driver needs to test every method (Every public method) in your class.
	Comments: This is the only optional field. Comments on anything you feel I should know. 
		Difficulties, challenges, things you liked, things you hated, anything etc. 

HomeWork Instructions:

	1) Referencing 'TextFileInputDemo' java class write a class called 'myFileInput' which reads the five lines from 'myDataFile.txt' and print them to the screen.
	2) Referencing 'TextFileOutputDemo' java class write a class called 'myFileOutput' which will write the following five lines to a file named '<yourName>OutputFile.txt'
		Philadelphia,44,rain
		Springfield,45,rain
		Tirana,56,sunny
		Amsterdam,57,cloudy
		Nice,60,sunny

	3) create a java class called 'Weather.java'
		a) This class will have 3 instance variables
			City - is a String
			Temp - is an int
			weather - is a String
		b) create all constructors, setters, getters, toString etc for this class

	4)  Write a driver called 'myWeatherDriver.java' and read your '<yourName>OutputFile.txt' file. 
		This driver will have an array called 'myWeatherData' which takes the type 'Weather'
		a) Read each line in a loop (in your example you will have 5 lines, I will test with a file with 10 lines). 
		b) after reading each line split each line into 3 respective columns using the split method. 
			https://www.javatpoint.com/java-string-split. <- a decent reference for split
			* NOTE: when you split you will need an array to store these values (This is a different array then myWeatherData). 
				Array[0] = city.   
				Array[1] = Temp
				Array[2] = weather
		c) After you split the data. Take these values and create a respective weather object using the weather class with these values
			    store these classes in the myWeatherData array
	    d) write another loop (for loop) and loop through the myWeatherData array.
	    	print each Weather's toString in the loop.
