	Comments: This is the only optional field. Comments on anything you feel I should know. 
		Difficulties, challenges, things you liked, things you hated, anything etc. 

HomeWork Instructions:

		- Make sure to handle any exceptions
	
	2) Write a polymorphic array for the animal class you completed in HW one. 
		- Create an array of length 10. 
		- Fill this array with 1 animal, 2 dogs, 2 cats, 2 pitbulls, and a garaffe.
		- Iterate through the array and have each animal speak. 

		B) write each animals toString to a file called "animals.txt"

	3) Create another Animal class called "AnimalAbstract.java" and make this class abstract. 
		- have an abstract method called drink() which takes no parameters.
