Homework 1 - Inheritance
Due Date : Oct 26 2017 ( NO Late Submissions, I will be posting answers for you to check)

Instructions:
	EVERY file needs comments at the top which has the following information
	Name: Your Name
	Class: Class Name, what your class does
	Output: Every class NEEDS a driver and every method in the class needs to be tested
		IF your driver has output it NEEDS to be here!

	Driver: EVERY Class NEEDS a driver. Every driver needs to test every method (Every public method) in your class.
	Comments: This is the only optional field. Comments on anything you feel I should know. 
		Difficulties, challenges, things you liked, things you hated, anything etc. 

HomeWork Instructions:

	1) Complete the Animal, Dog and Cat class. 
	   These classes do not have Setters, Getters, toString or Equals Methods. 
	   		Fill in the gaps in these classes and write the above methods. 

	2) Complete the PitBull class with all the needed Methods. 
		Override the speak method to have the Pitbull speak 3 times instead of once. 

	3) Create Giraffe class which inherits from the Animal class. 
		This class will have an instance variable called neckHeight.
		Have all neccessary methods for class.
		Giraffes voice frequency is too low for human ears. Override this method that just prints a blank statement. 

	4) Write drivers for all the classes created above (This will be how I check your HW). Make sure to test all of your methods in the driver. 




    - EMPLOYEE CLASS - ** The homework below is meant to be a bit more challenging, but the answers are also in your book **
     You are given the Employee class in Git (Please take a look and make sure you understand the class)
    	* This class also references the Date class for easy date recording * make sure to look and understand this class as well

    1) Before starting anything write a driver for the Date class
    	1a) Also write a driver for the employee class

    2) Create a HourlyEmployee class which inherits from the Employee class. 
    	This class has two instance variables called 
    		wageRate of type Double 
    		hours of type double

    	Create all constructors, setters, getters, toString and equals methods for HourlyEmployee class

    	*Do error checking. Check if the hours are below zero (this is not allowed) or if the wage is below 7.50 (we have a min age here). and any other checks you think are important.

    3) Create a SalariedEmployee Class which inherits from the Employee class
    	this class has one instance var
    		salary of type double

    	Create all constructors, setters, getters, toString and equals methods for HourlyEmployee class
